# IoT-Final-Project

## Dashboards for Covid-19 and Deforestation-Rainfall

The above project was done as a course project for the course IOT (Fall of 2021) by Aditi Dwivedi, Aniket Kumar, Hrishikesh Kulkarni and Prachhi Mishra. 

### Covid-19 Dashboard:
This Dashboard gives the user a brief idea about the spread of virus across India and World.

The Choloropeth graphs discuss about the severity of cases across India. The bar graph conveys various parameters like fatality ratio, total cases, active cases and total deaths across India. Apart from discussing about Covid-19 cases, we also reflected the status of vaccination across India. The running bar graph displays about total cases rising daily across world.

Tools used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Ploty
- Numpy
